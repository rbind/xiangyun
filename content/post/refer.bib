 abstract={Kernel smoothing is one of the most widely used non-parametric data smoothing techniques. We introduce a new R package ks for multivariate kernel smoothing. Currently it contains functionality for kernel density estimation and kernel discriminant analysis. It is a comprehensive package for bandwidth matrix selection, implementing a wide range of data-driven diagonal and unconstrained bandwidth selectors.},
